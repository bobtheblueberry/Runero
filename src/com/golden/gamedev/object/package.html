	<li>{@link com.golden.gamedev.object.Background} class, can be imagine as the place where the sprite lived.</li>
	<li>{@link com.golden.gamedev.object.SpriteGroup} class is a class to manage many sprites easily by grouping a group of same behaviour sprites.</li>
	<li>{@link com.golden.gamedev.object.PlayField} class, where all the objects (sprites and background) stored and managed.</li>
	<li>{@link com.golden.gamedev.object.CollisionManager} class to manage collision between the sprites.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>GTGE provides a complete sprite handling, from updating and showing the sprite itself to the screen (with animation or still), placing the sprites in various background types (eg: tiling background, parallax background, etc), and detecting the collision between the sprites in clean way.</p>
