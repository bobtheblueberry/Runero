With GTGE sprite management, your game development would be much easier!</p>

<p><u>How to use this package</u> :<br />
Start from subclassing <code>Game</code> class and make your game in it, then load/initialize the class using <code>GameLoader</code> class.<br />
After the game is getting bigger and the game logic is urgently need to be in separated entities (eg: separating title menu from the game play), use <code>GameEngine</code> class with its companion class, the <code>GameObject</code> class.</p>
